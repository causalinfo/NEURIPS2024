# About the Minisymposium

Although randomized controlled experiments are commonly used to help scientists understand important relationships between variables, these experiments may not always be feasible or ethical. Given these practical limitations and the widespread practice of collecting high-dimensional data, researchers are increasingly interested in using causal inference and information theory to gain insights from observational data. With wide-ranging applications in domains like physics, neuroscience, earth science, healthcare, and computer science, techniques from causal inference and information theory aim to mathematically characterize the most complex and fundamental processes in the universe. Unfortunately, classical methods in causal inference and information theory are quite restrictive, which substantially diminishes their applicability to datasets with high noise, complex noise characteristics, interaction effects, and nonlinear relationships. This online minisymposium will feature top researchers from around the world who aim to remove these restrictions from a variety of interesting angles.
