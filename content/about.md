# About the Workshop
Identifying causal variables and quantifying the underlying causal mechanisms are primary research goals in many important domains, including physics, medicine, earth sciences, and economics. Although randomized controlled experiments have historically been praised as the gold-standard for scientific discovery, such experiments are often infeasible or unethical. In contrast, observational data is generally easy to obtain, due to advances in data collection, storage, and analysis. The scientific community has increasingly turned to causal inference from observational data for insights into the data-generating process. This workshop is intended to showcase and develop state-of-the-art methods for two distinct goals in causal inference: 1. Causal structure learning from observational data, and 2. System identification of the data-generating process from observational data. Our workshop will focus on the setting of time series observational data. We invite both theoretical contributions and applications on real-world data, with topics including (but not limited to):

**Causal structure learning**
- Algorithms for learning causal graphs (ex. summary causal graph) from time series data
- Independence testing for time series data
- Learning temporal functional relationships
- Methods from information theory (transfer entropy, partial transfer entropy, partial information decomposition)
- Uncertainty quantification for causal structures 

**System Identification**
- Parameter estimation for the underlying stochastic differential equation (SDE) or ordinary differential equation (ODE)
- Learning Nonstationary, heteroscedastic, lagged relationships
- Necessary and sufficient conditions for system identifiability 
- Uncertainty quantification for parameter estimation

**Applications to other fields**
- Interpretable machine learning 
- Causality for fairness
- Causal discovery for Earth sciences
- Causal discovery for health sciences

If accepted, we plan to invite researchers to submit short papers (5-9 pages excluding references) or mini papers (1-4 pages excluding references). Submitted short papers should include novel theoretical, experimental and/or application-based contributions to one or more of the topics listed above. Mini papers should express interesting ideas for future work or novel works in progress.
