# About the Workshop
Causal system identification is a primary research goal in many important domains, including physics, medicine, Earth sciences, and economics. In particular, researchers are interested in: (1) learning the underlying causal structure between variables (e.g., learning the causal graph), (2) determining the functional relationships between variables (e.g., linear or nonlinear), and (3) estimating the strengths of these relationships (e.g. parameter estimation within a functional model).

In the last few decades, the causal inference community has developed theory and methods to satisfy these objectives from observational data. However, many of these methods do not leverage temporal dynamics. In contrast, many scientists aim to identify the underlying dynamical system, but the most popular approaches typically prioritize prediction over causality and parameter estimation.

This workshop aims to develop the connection between the fields of causal inference and system identification. In particular, we would like to showcase, apply, and develop state-of-the-art methods for the three related goals in the setting of time series data. We invite both theoretical contributions and applications on real-world data, with topics including (but not limited to):


## Causal structure learning from time series data
- Algorithms for learning causal graphs from time series data
- Independence testing for time series data
- Methods from information theory (transfer entropy, partial transfer entropy, partial information decomposition)
- Uncertainty quantification for causal structures 


## System identification for dynamical systems
- Parameter estimation for the underlying stochastic differential equation (SDE) or ordinary differential equation (ODE)
- Learning temporal functional relationships (ex. nonstationary, heteroscedastic, lagged relationships)
- Necessary and sufficient conditions for system identifiability 
- Uncertainty quantification for parameter estimation
- Connections to causal effect estimation


## Applications to other fields
- Causal discovery for Earth sciences
- Causal discovery for health sciences
- Econometrics
- System identification for engineering and control
- Interpretable machine learning 
- Causality for fairness and privacy


If accepted, we plan to invite researchers to submit short papers (5-9 pages excluding references) or mini papers (1-4 pages excluding references). Submitted short papers should include novel theoretical, experimental and/or application-based contributions to one or more of the topics listed above. Mini papers should express interesting ideas for future work or novel works in progress.
